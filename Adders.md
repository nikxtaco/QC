Quantum circuits are models for quantum computation in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates. 

## Quantum Gates

### X Gate

An X gate equates to a rotation around the X-axis of the Bloch sphere by ùúã radians. It maps |0‚ü© to |1‚ü© and |1‚ü© to |0‚ü©. It is the quantum equivalent of the NOT gate for classical computers and is sometimes called a bit-flip. If you are not familiar with linear algebra, you can learn it here: https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-appendix/linear_algebra.html.
